*Title:* Measuring Height with a Smartphone and Numerical Integration

*Abstract:* Using the accelerometer found in most ordinary smartphones, we record acceleration in linear motion. In a spreadsheet, we numerically integrate the acceleration data twice to obtain position data. From the position data, we determine the distance traveled. This exercise fits easily into a single class period in an integral calculus class with a small amount of scaffolding. We will demonstrate the activity during the presentation. In this activity, students gain a data-centered appreciation of some of the numerical methods of calculus. The activity also allows deeper exploration of the acceleration-velocity-position relationship.

If you want to use these materials, you should get an app to record the raw
data from your phone's accelerometer. I've used two:
